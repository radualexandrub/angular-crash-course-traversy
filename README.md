# AngularCrashCourse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0. This projects consists of a Tasks App from Traversy Media Angular Crash Course.

## Install Dependecies

Run `npm install`.

## Front-End Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```bash
ng serve --open
```

## Back-End MockUp DATA API

Run in CMD Prompt: `npm run server`. Now we will have our Angular Front-End App on http://localhost:4200/, and Mock REST API Back-end on http://localhost:5000/ (where we can make GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests just like on a real server made with Django/Express.js/Node.js/Spring-Java/etc).

```bash
npm run server
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project as a static Application (independent from the Development Environment that is ran by `ng server --open`). The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
